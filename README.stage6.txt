Note: program needs to be run as root to allow raw_socket creation

a) Reused Code: The checksum function in router.c is copied from RFC 1071. The helper function display is from stack exchange, however, this was only used for debugging purposes and is not used in the actual program.

b) Complete: No, this stage is not yet completed. Only the intial router and proxy setup is done. All traffic between them is unencrypted.
